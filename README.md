# Abstract
Our project aims to tackle the challenge of inadequate census population data in underdeveloped countries, while also providing a means to forecast populations in new developments. Leveraging landcover image data and tracts geometry, our approach involves computing zonal statistics and employing a regression model. Our success will be evaluated based on the accuracy of our predictive model, thereby offering a quantitative measure of our impact in addressing the lack population in certain areas.

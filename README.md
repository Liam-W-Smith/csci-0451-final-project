# Abstract
Our project aims to tackle the challenge of inadequate census population data in underdeveloped countries, while also providing a means to forecast populations in emerging developments. Leveraging landcover image data and tracts geometry, our approach involves computing zonal statistics and employing regression modeling. Success will be evaluated based on the accuracy of our predictive model, thereby offering a quantitative measure of our impact in addressing the data deficit and facilitating informed decision-making in these regions.
